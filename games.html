                        <p class="games__review--text">So, I think a lot of people would be going in and expecting the Stanley Parable- which is fair, I guess. But if you haven’t watched the trailer – don’t watch it, just buy it, and remove any expectations you have!). If you are a creator of *anything*, you should play this game. If you still want to know if the game is worth getting, here’s my experience with playing it:

                            I first played it in an empty office at 3am, I... usually get in the office when everyone is leaving and leave when everyone arrives the next morning. I’m bad at people sometimes. When I downloaded it - I don’t really know what I was expecting, but I decided to have a doodle pad next to me

                            I started off by writing about the game, and then a portrait of the person described, and then about myself... The cute imagery on the notes soon turned to darker scribbles and tearstained mush. I don’t know any media that’s ever made me feel this way. The last time I cried this much was when my dog (and best friend) was to be put down.

                            Alone, in an office, 4am, listening to the ending song on repeat, uncontrollably sobbing. For a place that I felt the most alone- I suddenly didn’t feel that way anymore. These however, were not sad tears.

                            Fast forward 2 months to remote Sweden. I met an amazing developer, who we shared similar thoughts, feelings and origin stories about game / solo development. I forgot why, but we were talking about creative anxiety, and showing people our games. On the spur of the moment I said “I need to show you this game, you will understand it”. I had longed for someone I could talk about this game with, (and I felt guilty fanning to the developer about their own work), and, weirdly enough it was an empty office at 3am – in the woods, but it was just the two of us. Alone together.

                            What came after was what seemed like the longest hug. The morning sun started filling up the room, and it was just the two of us just sobbing, paralyzed by emotion. It’s hard to describe such an intimate moment, but seeing a person cry like you cried a couple of months earlier is surreal. I don’t have a good memory, but this is one that I will remember and cherish forever.

                            I’ve been making games for 10 years but never released anything because I’ve been afraid of what people might think. After playing this game, I realized everything will be okay. It’s not going to be easy, but it will be okay.
                            And that to me is the best gift that anyone can give.
                            Play this game or gift it to someone special.</p>

                        <p class="games__review--text">Life is Strange is a story-focused game with minimal gameplay. Loved it, although the player's decisions don't seem to impact the story all that much.

                            Visuals & Soundtracks
                            The game has a pretty style, and the interface looks like hand drawings. The soundtrack is amazing, lots of nice songs, really enhances the atmosphere of the game.

                            Gameplay
                            This is a story-focused game, where the gameplay is not as prominent as in other games. Mainly, it revolves around Max's ability to rewind time, which the game encourages you to use in creative ways. It's a very cool power and a very nice feature in-game, and I really enjoyed trying to find when and how to use it. However, I think it was underused here, as all the "puzzles" in the game are very simple and easy. With an interesting power like that, I'm sure the devs could have come up with more complicated and challenging ways to use it.

                            This rewind power also means that it's impossible to fail anything in the game, as you can almost always rewind your bad choices and your failures. There is one instance in the game where this rewind option is taken away, and I think the game would have greatly benefited from doing this a lot more often.

                            All that means that the game is very casual-friendly, and very chill. You won't be stressed too much about your choices, as you'll be able to rewind them if the immediate outcome is not one you want.

                            Story
                            The story setting is very cliché, it takes place in an American high school. But despite that, the story is really good. It's captivating, engaging and emotional. The main character, Max, is very likeable, and her friendship with Chloe is very well done. Voice acting is very good for the most part. The story is clearly the main focus of this game, and in that regard it's a total success. It's the kind of story that stays with you for at least a little while after you finish the game.

                            Choices are sometimes tough to make, which is great. However - and that's probably my biggest criticism - most of them don't actually matter all that much. Sure, characters will talk about and refer to those decisions later on, but in most cases there isn't any real change to the story (there's one or two exceptions, but that's not enough). The story will unfold pretty much the same way no matter what you do.

                            Conclusion
                            Despite the few flaws I've mentioned in this review, I had a great time playing this game. I recommend it for anyone who wants to enjoy a great story, while seeking a relaxing and non-challenging gaming experience.</p>

                        <p class="games__review--text">For a time, I've heard people compare this game to Undertale, and I figured that it was perhaps because the gameplay is similar, or that it puts a focus on simpler graphics in an effort to convey mechanics and story over visuals. While those are both arguably true, I think those analyses are somewhat shallow, and I'm still kicking myself for thinking those might have ever been all this game had to offer.

                            Everhood can and should be compared to Undertale, not because the games have similar art styles or gameplay, but because both games are unique in their respect for the player.

                            Everhood is a masterfully crafted piece of art. It feels as though every single part of this experience was crafted with love. From the truly epic, memorable scores unique to each boss fight, to the imaginative world in which the story takes place, to the nuanced characters with deep backstories and personalities, no expense was spared in the creation of this game. It's one of the few games that I'm truly honored to play, and it will stick with me in a way that very few pieces of media ever will.

                            An unforgettable experience with enough trust and respect for the player to share all of the incredible ideas it has to offer. If you even *think* you might like this game, I urge you to try it.</p>

The last time I cried this much was when my dog (and best friend) was to be put down.

                        Alone, in an office, 4am, listening to the ending song on repeat, uncontrollably sobbing. For a place that I felt the most alone- I suddenly didn’t feel that way anymore. These however, were not sad tears.

                        Fast forward 2 months to remote Sweden. I met an amazing developer, who we shared similar thoughts, feelings and origin stories about game / solo development. I forgot why, but we were talking about creative anxiety, and showing people our games. On the spur of the moment I said “I need to show you this game, you will understand it”. I had longed for someone I could talk about this game with, (and I felt guilty fanning to the developer about their own work), and, weirdly enough it was an empty office at 3am – in the woods, but it was just the two of us. Alone together.

                        What came after was what seemed like the longest hug. The morning sun started filling up the room, and it was just the two of us just sobbing, paralyzed by emotion. It’s hard to describe such an intimate moment, but seeing a person cry like you cried a couple of months earlier is surreal. I don’t have a good memory, but this is one that I will remember and cherish forever.

                        I’ve been making games for 10 years but never released anything because I’ve been afraid of what people might think. After playing this game, I realized everything will be okay. It’s not going to be easy, but it will be okay.
                        And that to me is the best gift that anyone can give.
                        Play this game or gift it to someone special <3</p>
