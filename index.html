            <p>Hello and welcome to my website, where I write reviews for all kinds of media. I'm your host Sergej Bogatinoski and I hope you will have a wonderful stay. Currently I don't have many reviews, but as time goes on I will keep adding more and more both positive and negative ones. I don't use a rating system, because rating stuff is hard. If more people keep coming to my website I might even add a feedback or some kind of engagement with my fans. But for now feel free to check out all of the reviews I have on my site, even though they might be a copy from google.  <br>Note: The search bar doesn't work because this website DOES NOT have a backend, so for now it's there because it looks cool.</p>
