                    <p class="movie__review--text">Toxicity can be looked at from multiple angles, especially when one accepts that no matter how hard we try there will always be a toxic part of ourselves. Within life, it’s the gentle balance between healthily suppressing the virulent and also expressing it in a non-harmful manner (for ourselves as well as those around us). What’s so intriguing to me within music is how an artist’s persona (not the artist themself) is able to fully embrace the toxic, creating music that doesn’t attempt to filter out the deepest, darkest shit one’s destructive version thinks of. When talking to other people about this concept I often use the Rick and Morty episode ‘Rest and Ricklaxation’ as an apt analogy, and for those who’ve managed to avoid the show thusfar, the plot circulates around the idea of completely separating oneself from their own “toxins”, leaving behind two separate personas that are undeniably connected to each other.

                        I feel as though I’m rambling, but my point is far from imprudent; Ghostemane is one of the few rappers that is completely in touch with the toxic version of himself. Throughout his career, he’s delved into occultism, demons, sexual impulses, death, etc. all in a strange yet unique medley of $uicideboy$ rap voices, black metal production, and outbursts of raw emotion. The exciting thing about N/O/I/S/E is that he’s advertised the album as his hardest, darkest and loudest attempt yet. Without spoiling too much, the album definitely delivers in that aspect, yet what’s even more impressive for a long-time fan is the release’s ability to sound thematically constructed and complete. Although structurally the flow of the bangers-into-industrial experiments more than helps, it’s moreso his complete immersion into the venomous, spiteful side of Eric Whitney (notice the inclusion of his real name). I don’t want to speculate that in the past he’s held back, so to speak, but rather I’m trying to emphasize how the album sounds like someone truly in touch with the good and bad sides of themselves, consciously choosing to let the bad perform a chaotic tantrum for those who may see a part of themselves within the persona.

                        ‘Nihil’ and it’s first line “I’ve been in a rut…” is quick to expel this poison, accompanied by Ghostemane’s signature detached deep growl and a mosh-inducing stop-start bass pattern. Previous songs like ‘Rake’ have teased this fusion of harsh punk and turbulent trap, but within the first four tracks the contrast is extremely apparent. ‘Flesh’ features whispered space and metal-influenced breakdowns, yet the single’s centerpiece is a high-pitched rapped verse that is shot out with the mechanical ease of a machine gun. While these few tracks are easily some of his most hype songs, it’s the latter half that encapsulates the guttural, hellish feeling Ghostemane so naturally conveys. ‘Inside’ sounds like something off of The Downward Spiral as it doesn’t fully return to the rap sound until the closing minute, instead opting for a thrashing buzz of synths and guitars while Ghostemane yells about recent bouts of depression and loss. The closing verse of this track mirrors this in a reflective, mature way, “Why y'all think I'm cool？ I don't like that / Rest in peace Gus, wanna bring you back / Don't tell me to collab with aesthetic trends / All these rappers got you fooled they ain't really friends”. It’s a nod to a lost friend (Lil Peep) yet also a very self-aware diss towards the commodification of posthumous material and Ghostemane’s own resilience to participate in this side of rap. It’s admirable, especially considering the entire release was self-made and put out without a label. ‘Gatteka’ furthers this conscious separation from other rappers (“I just can’t relate…”) and the closing two tracks explore how this isolation is affecting his own psyche (‘I think I was born in the wrong generation / nobody talks to me, nobody is relating”).

                        While the closer is nearly completely out of character for the rapper and N/O/I/S/E, it’s a touchingly bitter way to cap things off. Featuring a simply plucked guitar, it’s a song about the parallel of longing for someone and the anxiety that comes with it, letting the blackness of these feelings literally translate into disturbing static noise that leaves one extremely uneasy. As a whole the album sounds like it was recorded in a murky cave; Ghostemane’s voice is often intimate and echoey as you can vividly hear his intense screams as well as his anxious breaths. Within this dark dwelling is a world constructed by the toxic waste he chooses to let go, filling the cavernous void with horrifying structures and figures that resemble his own pains. It’s successfully frightening and original in how it splatters influences and personal hardships across the damp walls. It’s where the toxic version of Eric Whitney lives, so pay him a visit at your own risk.</p>

                        <p class="movie__director music__artist u-margin-bottom-small">Burzum</p> 
                    </div>
                    <p class="movie__review u-margin-bottom-micro">Review</p>
                    <p class="movie__review--text">Filosofem is quite a hard thing to approach, even for metalheads or black metal fans. It's not because of accessibilty, as the album is quite famous ("Burzum/Dunkelheit" was also aired on MTv as video) and easy to get; it's something entirely linked to the music.

                        The album is notoriously a quintessence of low-fi production and its quality is generally worse than average, yet not as bad as you'd believe at first, at least not concerning the instruments that all have a distinct space and sounding. This low-fi gives the whole thing an aura of respect, which in the end makes totally sense: this music doesn't need to be beautiful and perfect, as it has a dark, mesmerizing sound of its own, making it fully enjoyable where other issues would be roasted if they sounded the same. Together with the "unholy trinity" albums by Darkthrone, I see Burzum's early productions as the Norwegian black metal true statement records, what defines the genre in terms of style, ideology, execution (yeah, sorry Mayhem). This is as far away as you can go from polished, well defined and accessible music. This is something meant to be hard to grasp, elitistic.

                        Tracks are basically built of repetitive and cold guitar riffs, creating almost a trance. Yet, surprisingly, with a high sense of melody. Already present on Burzum and Hvis lyset tar oss, melody in this album is given not by music alone but also by all the small variations in main riffage, in the attention to atmospheric sounds and the pauses: all this contributes to create a melody that is not soothing and meditative, rather spell-bounding - in a dark sense of the term.

                        There are some really good tracks on Filosofem, like "Burzum/Dunkelheit" whose main riff is just as famous as "Freezing Moon" and just as iconic; "Jesu død", a 10 minutes long riff failing - however- to grow tiresome on the listener and filled with chilling and eerie atmosphere; ""Beholding the Daughters of the Firmament" which is probably the best track on the album, with an excellent obsessive riff and desperate, faint screams able to evoke spine-chilling atmospheres with a haunting, bleak and obscure sense of emptiness building up around you. The low-fi sounding and the raspy guitars adds only more authenticity to this, and everything is greatly supported by the absurd vocal performance.

                        In fact, vocals are just awful, but nicely so, as they are one of the pillars on which the greatness of this album stands. They are deep in the background, sounding like distant, desperate otherwordly shrieks. They destroy any safe feelings that may build up by the quieter, atmospheric parts, they arrive as needles piercing your ear and mind. Willingly recorded with the worst technical support possible, they create a sort of shrieking droning that is both chilling and fascinating, as some strange sound luring you further inside the deep, dark woods.

                        Filosofem closes with two instrumental ambient tracks, recorded while Varg was in prison and did not have access to other instruments but a keyboard. Although they are some nice ambient music pieces, they contrast too much with the rest of the album and the result is a little weird, splitting the album in two distinct and opposing parts that differ too much from eachother to form a working unity.

                        As said, it takes some effort to enjoy this album, you need so to say some "meat on the bones" regarding black metal. I would not suggest to listen to it as your introduction to the genre, or to Burzum. Like a quality spirit, it takes some taste training to fully appreciate. Personally, it took some time before I was able to listen to Burzum and pass beyond the "what the f... did he do with the recording??" reaction. Once I did, though, I understood the high quality of this release. You may judge Varg Vikernes in many ways, but undoubtedly he had talent for music, perhaps still has (but this is a story for another time).</p>

                    <p class="movie__review--text">It’s odd that a band who, unconventionally, has nine members can be so formulaic. Slipknot is a huge gimmick and it is of no surprise that, given the American metal landscape that their gimmick was marketable, and has led the band to commercial success. They wear gruesome masks and write seriously heavy, angst-ridden music. Add in some rap and heavy distortion to make them appear hip and you’ve got a band that angry teenagers (usually for little reason), who know nothing about real music, will eat up. These same elements will also make them despised by most metal purists. I for one, tried my best to hate these guys when they first broke into the mainstream, but I could not ignore their heaviness, attitude and aggression which are elements that I enjoy in my metal so I decided to check them out. Sure, the anger is contrived and the lyrics are designed for disillusioned youth everywhere to identify with, but that marketing strategy is hardly new and neither is metal bands that use gimmicks to sell records, so I won’t hold this, their image and their commercial success against them. Rather, I will focus on their music, which really should be the ONLY reason some one does or does not like them.

                        I believe the old saying; “Too many cooks spoil the broth” is a good way to describe many of the songs on this album. Yes, they are extremely heavy and their sound is nice and thick, but having nine band members trying to contribute often results in a jumbled mess. Add heavy distortion and constant guitar feedback and often what you end up with is unlistenable noise that actually bothers your ears. Tattered and Torn is a great example of this. Distortion and screeching sound effects are an effective and easy way to create filler for an album and a cheap way to try and make an album sound angry. Marilyn Manson is often guilty of this, as he and Slipknot both go for the same pseudo-disturbing image and sound. I believe that both bands would do well to strip down their sound a bit and ease off the distortion.

                        Another element of this album that turns me off is the rap element which there is plenty of on this album. Whenever Corey Taylor begins to rap, virtually whatever potential the song once had goes out of the window and the song turns to crap. This happens on Only One, Spit it Out and No Life, and effectively ruins these songs. It’s a shame because I like some of what Slipknot offers on this album, such as the crunching heavy riffs, the drums (When the percussionists aren’t over doing it and using the lame “Tin drum sound” which Metallica would eventually copy) and the vocals (When Cory is barking and not rapping) as well as the anger and aggression (no matter how contrived it is, it still sounds convincing) However, on this album, the negatives far outweigh the positives.

                        Highlights of this album include the tracks Sic, Wait and Bleed and Surfacing. Sic is seriously heavy and pissed off and despite the presence of a turntable, still manages to be a good track. Wait and Bleed is commercial Slipknot so it is turned down a notch and has some actual singing on it, however, the song gets super heavy at the end and features a killer last riff. What separates Surfacing from other filler and wastes of time on this album is the killer chorus. It screams attitude. Every other song on the album is either average or crap. Unfortunately, the nihilistic theme of this album and the angst starts to wear thin after a while. It seems that somewhere, maybe half way through the album, that “I’m so pissed” seems to turn into “Why Me?” which makes the album seem to drag on and on effectively burying what interest I had left for the songs at the end of the album. Speaking of dragging on, the last track Scissors has a huge pause at the end of the song and then, around the 13:24 mark, there is some dialogue which is just plain stupid and I won’t even go into that. However, the track doesn’t end there, as there is one super fast and heavy song played which is better than half of the songs on this album. It’s a shame that they buried this song at the very end of the album and that you can’t just skip right to it. Instead, you have to manually fast foward if you don’t want to sit through silence and silly banter. Personally, I hate it when bands do this as it makes putting the CD on random a pain in the ass.

                        This album is only listenable to those who are fans of nu-metal as each song contains elements of the genre. However, although there are some things that I like about this album, in the end, there is also way too much that I don’t.</p>

It seems that somewhere, maybe half way through the album, that “I’m so pissed” seems to turn into “Why Me?” which makes the album seem to drag on and on effectively burying what interest I had left for the songs at the end of the album. Speaking of dragging on, the last track Scissors has a huge pause at the end of the song and then, around the 13:24 mark, there is some dialogue which is just plain stupid and I won’t even go into that. However, the track doesn’t end there, as there is one super fast and heavy song played which is better than half of the songs on this album. It’s a shame that they buried this song at the very end of the album and that you can’t just skip right to it. Instead, you have to manually fast foward if you don’t want to sit through silence and silly banter. Personally, I hate it when bands do this as it makes putting the CD on random a pain in the ass.

                        This album is only listenable to those who are fans of nu-metal as each song contains elements of the genre. However, although there are some things that I like about this album, in the end, there is also way too much that I don’t.</p>

                    <p>Filosofem is quite a hard thing to approach, even for metalheads or black metal fans. It's not because of accessibilty, as the album is quite famous ("Burzum/Dunkelheit" was also aired on MTv as video) and easy to get; it's something entirely linked to the music.

                        The album is notoriously a quintessence of low-fi production and its quality is generally worse than average, yet not as bad as you'd believe at first, at least not concerning the instruments that all have a distinct space and sounding. This low-fi gives the whole thing an aura of respect, which in the end makes totally sense: this music doesn't need to be beautiful and perfect, as it has a dark, mesmerizing sound of its own, making it fully enjoyable where other issues would be roasted if they sounded the same. Together with the "unholy trinity" albums by Darkthrone, I see Burzum's early productions as the Norwegian black metal true statement records, what defines the genre in terms of style, ideology, execution (yeah, sorry Mayhem). This is as far away as you can go from polished, well defined and accessible music. This is something meant to be hard to grasp, elitistic.

                        Tracks are basically built of repetitive and cold guitar riffs, creating almost a trance. Yet, surprisingly, with a high sense of melody. Already present on Burzum and Hvis lyset tar oss, melody in this album is given not by music alone but also by all the small variations in main riffage, in the attention to atmospheric sounds and the pauses: all this contributes to create a melody that is not soothing and meditative, rather spell-bounding - in a dark sense of the term.

                        There are some really good tracks on Filosofem, like "Burzum/Dunkelheit" whose main riff is just as famous as "Freezing Moon" and just as iconic; "Jesu død", a 10 minutes long riff failing - however- to grow tiresome on the listener and filled with chilling and eerie atmosphere; ""Beholding the Daughters of the Firmament" which is probably the best track on the album, with an excellent obsessive riff and desperate, faint screams able to evoke spine-chilling atmospheres with a haunting, bleak and obscure sense of emptiness building up around you. The low-fi sounding and the raspy guitars adds only more authenticity to this, and everything is greatly supported by the absurd vocal performance.

                        In fact, vocals are just awful, but nicely so, as they are one of the pillars on which the greatness of this album stands. They are deep in the background, sounding like distant, desperate otherwordly shrieks. They destroy any safe feelings that may build up by the quieter, atmospheric parts, they arrive as needles piercing your ear and mind. Willingly recorded with the worst technical support possible, they create a sort of shrieking droning that is both chilling and fascinating, as some strange sound luring you further inside the deep, dark woods.

                        Filosofem closes with two instrumental ambient tracks, recorded while Varg was in prison and did not have access to other instruments but a keyboard. Although they are some nice ambient music pieces, they contrast too much with the rest of the album and the result is a little weird, splitting the album in two distinct and opposing parts that differ too much from eachother to form a working unity.

                        As said, it takes some effort to enjoy this album, you need so to say some "meat on the bones" regarding black metal. I would not suggest to listen to it as your introduction to the genre, or to Burzum. Like a quality spirit, it takes some taste training to fully appreciate. Personally, it took some time before I was able to listen to Burzum and pass beyond the "what the f... did he do with the recording??" reaction. Once I did, though, I understood the high quality of this release. You may judge Varg Vikernes in many ways, but undoubtedly he had talent for music, perhaps still has (but this is a story for another time).</p>

                    <p>Toxicity can be looked at from multiple angles, especially when one accepts that no matter how hard we try there will always be a toxic part of ourselves. Within life, it’s the gentle balance between healthily suppressing the virulent and also expressing it in a non-harmful manner (for ourselves as well as those around us). What’s so intriguing to me within music is how an artist’s persona (not the artist themself) is able to fully embrace the toxic, creating music that doesn’t attempt to filter out the deepest, darkest shit one’s destructive version thinks of. When talking to other people about this concept I often use the Rick and Morty episode ‘Rest and Ricklaxation’ as an apt analogy, and for those who’ve managed to avoid the show thusfar, the plot circulates around the idea of completely separating oneself from their own “toxins”, leaving behind two separate personas that are undeniably connected to each other.

                        I feel as though I’m rambling, but my point is far from imprudent; Ghostemane is one of the few rappers that is completely in touch with the toxic version of himself. Throughout his career, he’s delved into occultism, demons, sexual impulses, death, etc. all in a strange yet unique medley of $uicideboy$ rap voices, black metal production, and outbursts of raw emotion. The exciting thing about N/O/I/S/E is that he’s advertised the album as his hardest, darkest and loudest attempt yet. Without spoiling too much, the album definitely delivers in that aspect, yet what’s even more impressive for a long-time fan is the release’s ability to sound thematically constructed and complete. Although structurally the flow of the bangers-into-industrial experiments more than helps, it’s moreso his complete immersion into the venomous, spiteful side of Eric Whitney (notice the inclusion of his real name). I don’t want to speculate that in the past he’s held back, so to speak, but rather I’m trying to emphasize how the album sounds like someone truly in touch with the good and bad sides of themselves, consciously choosing to let the bad perform a chaotic tantrum for those who may see a part of themselves within the persona.

                        ‘Nihil’ and it’s first line “I’ve been in a rut…” is quick to expel this poison, accompanied by Ghostemane’s signature detached deep growl and a mosh-inducing stop-start bass pattern. Previous songs like ‘Rake’ have teased this fusion of harsh punk and turbulent trap, but within the first four tracks the contrast is extremely apparent. ‘Flesh’ features whispered space and metal-influenced breakdowns, yet the single’s centerpiece is a high-pitched rapped verse that is shot out with the mechanical ease of a machine gun. While these few tracks are easily some of his most hype songs, it’s the latter half that encapsulates the guttural, hellish feeling Ghostemane so naturally conveys. ‘Inside’ sounds like something off of The Downward Spiral as it doesn’t fully return to the rap sound until the closing minute, instead opting for a thrashing buzz of synths and guitars while Ghostemane yells about recent bouts of depression and loss. The closing verse of this track mirrors this in a reflective, mature way, “Why y'all think I'm cool？ I don't like that / Rest in peace Gus, wanna bring you back / Don't tell me to collab with aesthetic trends / All these rappers got you fooled they ain't really friends”. It’s a nod to a lost friend (Lil Peep) yet also a very self-aware diss towards the commodification of posthumous material and Ghostemane’s own resilience to participate in this side of rap. It’s admirable, especially considering the entire release was self-made and put out without a label. ‘Gatteka’ furthers this conscious separation from other rappers (“I just can’t relate…”) and the closing two tracks explore how this isolation is affecting his own psyche (‘I think I was born in the wrong generation / nobody talks to me, nobody is relating”).

                        While the closer is nearly completely out of character for the rapper and N/O/I/S/E, it’s a touchingly bitter way to cap things off. Featuring a simply plucked guitar, it’s a song about the parallel of longing for someone and the anxiety that comes with it, letting the blackness of these feelings literally translate into disturbing static noise that leaves one extremely uneasy. As a whole the album sounds like it was recorded in a murky cave; Ghostemane’s voice is often intimate and echoey as you can vividly hear his intense screams as well as his anxious breaths. Within this dark dwelling is a world constructed by the toxic waste he chooses to let go, filling the cavernous void with horrifying structures and figures that resemble his own pains. It’s successfully frightening and original in how it splatters influences and personal hardships across the damp walls. It’s where the toxic version of Eric Whitney lives, so pay him a visit at your own risk.</p>
